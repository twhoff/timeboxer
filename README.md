Project Summary: Time Blocking App
Current State:

Core Features Implemented:

Grid Layout for days of the week and time intervals.

Time Block Creation by clicking and dragging within day columns.

Dynamic Time Indicator for selected intervals.

Persistent State using IndexedDB for time blocks.

Recent Fixes and Improvements:

Alignment Issues: Addressed by using static heights for intervals and time blocks.

Styling Consistency: Applied box-sizing: border-box globally for predictable layout dimensions.

Tooling Setup: Integrated TypeScript, ESLint (Airbnb config), and Prettier:

ESLint and Prettier configurations are set to enforce:

4-space indentation

No semicolons

Double quotes in JSX, single quotes elsewhere

No unused variables or imports

No nested ternary expressions

Scripts added to package.json for linting and formatting.

Next Steps:

TypeScript Migration: Continue converting JavaScript files to TypeScript for type safety.

Testing: Implement unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

Feature Enhancements: Consider adding local storage or service workers for offline persistence.

UI/UX: Refine the user interface for better user experience.
