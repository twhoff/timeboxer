Time Blocking App
Project Summary
The Time Blocking App aims to provide users with a simple interface to manage their time effectively by allowing them to create and visualize time blocks across different days and intervals.

Current State
Core Features Implemented:
Grid Layout: Displays days of the week and time intervals in a structured grid format.

Time Block Creation: Users can create time blocks by clicking and dragging within day columns.

Dynamic Time Indicator: Provides real-time feedback for selected time intervals.

Persistent State: Time blocks are stored persistently using IndexedDB.

Recent Fixes and Improvements:
Alignment Issues: Resolved using static heights for intervals and time blocks to ensure consistent visual alignment.

Styling Consistency: Applied box-sizing: border-box globally for predictable layout dimensions, enhancing styling consistency.

Tooling Setup:
TypeScript Integration: Started migrating JavaScript files to TypeScript for improved type safety and maintainability.

ESLint and Prettier: Configured to enforce:

4-space indentation

No semicolons

Double quotes in JSX, single quotes elsewhere

No unused variables or imports

No nested ternary expressions

Scripts: Added linting and formatting scripts to package.json.

Next Steps
TypeScript Migration:
Continue converting remaining JavaScript files to TypeScript. We have successfully converted App.jsx and db.js to TypeScript, but further conversion is needed.

Testing:
Implement unit and integration tests using Jest and React Testing Library to ensure robust functionality and prevent regressions.

Feature Enhancements:
Explore adding local storage or service workers to enhance offline persistence capabilities.

UI/UX:
Refine the user interface for improved user experience, making it more intuitive and visually appealing.
